I'm a fullstack developer, have experience in web React, Nodejs, Salesforce.

When I'm not working I like to toy around with new technolgies, like Machine Learning and have interest to pursue this one day, after all who don't like to have some ML in their life. 
    
This is my personal blog and basically I will be mostly posting on Web related and sharing daily experiences or problem solving.
